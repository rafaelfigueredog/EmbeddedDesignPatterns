# Embedded Design Patterns
This repository contains a collection of design patterns from the GoF book, applied in the context of embedded systems. The project was created for educational purposes to demonstrate how design patterns can be used to improve the development of embedded systems.

## Design Patterns
The following design patterns are applied in this project:

### Creational Patterns
- Factory Method
- Builder
- Singleton

### Structural Patterns
- Adapter
- Facade

### Behavioral Patterns
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Iterator

## Usage
Each directory in the project corresponds to a specific design pattern. Inside each directory, you will find an example of how to use the pattern in the context of embedded systems. You can run the example code on your embedded system or simulation environment.
